# Traffic Management System

This project is designed to optimize traffic flow and manage traffic lights using AI techniques.
It includes several Python scripts and configuration files to set up and run a traffic simulation.

## Description

This system uses computer vision and AI algorithms to optimize traffic light schedules, reducing waiting times at intersections.
The `main.py` script serves as the entry point, integrating various modules like `traffic_light.py` and `video_utils.py`
to process video feeds and control traffic lights based on real-time traffic data.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
